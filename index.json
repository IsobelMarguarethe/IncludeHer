I’m also super passionate about equity in STEM!\nLikes: Spending too much money on secondhand books, travelling and being in nature.\nFun fact: My cat is named after moaning Myrtle from Harry Potter.\nContributions to Science: I’m the program manager of a STEM program for high school students and have been involved in the program for three years now. For the past year I’ve been working on a fun project about light pollution and dark skies and have developed an outreach/application guide for communities wishing to list an area with the IDA.\n","permalink":"https://isobelmarguarethe.github.io/IncludeHer/posts/post-tegan/","tags":["author","profile","author profile"],"title":"Author profile: Tegan"},{"categories":["Author","Profile","Author Profile"],"contents":"Name: Staci Pearlman\nField: Computational Chemistry and Science Communication\nBio: I have just graduated from a Bachelor of Science at the Australian National University, with a major in chemistry.

I’ve given presentations, run exhibitions, worked on the concept design of science activities, hosted telescope observing nights, written scientific articles for the local paper, and worked with volunteer movements like #IncludeHer.\n","permalink":"https://isobelmarguarethe.github.io/IncludeHer/posts/post-staci/","tags":["author","profile","author profile"],"title":"Author profile: Staci"},{"categories":["Author","Profile","Author Profile"],"contents":"Name: Andrew Battisti\nField: Galaxy Evolution\nBio: I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the Australian National University. My research focuses on improving our knowledge of how galaxies, and their constituent parts (e.g., stars, gas, dust), evolve from the early Universe into the diverse population that exists today.\nLikes: Sports, board games, reading, traveling, hiking\nFun fact: I’ve traveled to 14 countries in the past 6 years.\nContributions to Science: My recent work has been on improving our understanding of how interstellar dust within galaxies impacts our observations of galaxies at different wavelengths and also on modeling the light we see from galaxies over the entire electromagnetic spectrum.\nFurther info: my website\n","permalink":"https://isobelmarguarethe.github.io/IncludeHer/posts/post-andrew/","tags":["author","profile","author profile"],"title":"Author profile: Andrew"},{"categories":["Author","Profile","Author Profile"],"contents":"Name: Isabella Gerrard\nField: Computational Star Formation\nBio: I am currently a PhD candidate at the Australian National University (Canberra), originally from Bega NSW (yes, like the cheese!)\nLikes: Watercolours, gardening, lowering my carbon footprint\nFun fact: I have had every different colour of hair except green. Green is for grass, not hair.\nContributions to Science: The aim of my PhD is to make the most realistic computational models of how stars from to date. Using these models we hope to better understand the circumstellar environment in which planets form.\nFurther info: STEM Women Profile\n","permalink":"https://isobelmarguarethe.github.io/IncludeHer/posts/post-bella/","tags":["author","profile","author profile"],"title":"Author profile: Bella"},{"categories":["Author","Profile","Author Profile"],"contents":"Name: Isobel Romero-Shaw\nField: Gravitational Wave Astrophysics\nBio: I\u0026rsquo;m currently a PhD student at Monash university, Melbourne, Australia, but I was born and raised in the beautiful city of Bath, UK.\nLikes: Snails, drawing, baking, being kind to the environment\nFun fact: I have had two pet Giant African Land snails. These are illegal in Australia, so now I have five pet garden snails, which live in a tank on my desk.\nContributions to Science: I study gravitational waves \u0026ndash; tiny ripples in space-time. These tiny ripples are caused by colossal objects, like black holes, crashing into each other in distant galaxies. I try to work out how these colossal couples met each other in the first place. This involves analysing the gravitational-wave signals for characteristic wobbles, which can give us clues into the past lives of these enigmatic objects.\nFurther info: Website, Publications, Twitter, Art gallery\n","permalink":"https://isobelmarguarethe.github.io/IncludeHer/posts/post-isobel/","tags":["author","profile","author profile"],"title":"Author profile: Isobel"},{"categories":["Scientist","Historic","Profile","Historic Scientist Profile"],"contents":"Name: Ada Lovelace (Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace)\nField: Computer Science and Mathematics\nBio: Lived 10 December 1815 – 27 November 1852 (died at age 36) in the UK. Ada was the daughter of poet Lord Byron and his wife Lady Byron, though she was not close with either parent. Despite her lifelong bouts of severe illness, Lovelace studied hard. Partly out of fear that she might have inherited her poetic father\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;insanity\u0026rsquo;, her mother ensured that Ada was privately educated to a high standard, especially in logical pursuits like mathematics. Ada still harboured a belief that imagination was key to scientific breakthroughs and described her approach to science as \u0026lsquo;poetical\u0026rsquo;.\nFun fact: There is a computer programming language named after Ada, invented by the US Department of Defence and used in safety-critical programming applications, like software for aeroplanes. Since 2009, Ada Lovelace Day has been celebrated around the world on the second Tuesday of October, with the aim of raising the profile of women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics.\nContributions to Science: Ada worked closely with the so-called \u0026lsquo;Father of Modern Computing\u0026rsquo;, Charles Babbage. Lovelace is credited with writing the first-ever computer program, becoming the world\u0026rsquo;s first computer programmer. She is also thought to be the first person to recognise the potential for computers to be used for more than mere calculation, proposing that a computer might be able to compose original music if programmed to do so.\nFurther info: Wikipedia page, biography.com, computerhistory.org\n","permalink":"https://isobelmarguarethe.github.io/IncludeHer/posts/post-ada-lovelace/","tags":["historic","scientist","profile","historic scientist profile"],"title":"Historic scientist profile: Ada Lovelace"},{"categories":["Author","Profile","Author Profile"],"contents":"Name: Kat Ross\nField: Galaxy Evolution and Black Hole Variability\nBio: I am a PhD candidate at the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research based at Curtin University.
